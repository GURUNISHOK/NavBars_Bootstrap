# NavBars_Bootstrap
Bootsrap comes under the front-end of the web development 
framework and it is useful in creating an Web page which is responsive and the best part is it automatically 
adjusts themselves into all the handheld devices such as Mobile phones, tablets, iPads etc.
To be more specific, the bootstrap framework comprises of design templates for the Hyper Text Markup Language and 
Cascading Style Sheet for the buttons, tables, navigation, image, forms and supports the Java Script 
plugins. These features helps them in creating an responsive design web sites.



In this repository, I have created a basic Image Web Page with Navigation Bars and Images that are placed with in 
the containers respectively. The naviagtion bar helps in resizing the images according to the screen size of the web page.
